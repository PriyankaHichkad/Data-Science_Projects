This repository is a collection of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning projects developed over the years.
It serves as a central hub consolidating all my individual project repositories into one place for easier access, learning, and reference.


## Overview:
The projects included in this repository cover diverse areas of data science, including:
- **Supervised Learning:** Classification and Regression
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, Feature Engineering
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Stock Price Prediction, Trend Analysis
- **Model Evaluation & Optimization:** Hyperparameter tuning, Cross-validation, Metrics


## Tools & Technologies:
The following libraries, frameworks, and tools have been widely used across the projects:
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Models:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, KNN, and more
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch (in selective projects)
- **NLP:** NLTK, SpaCy, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Transformers
- **Time Series:** ARIMA, LSTM
- **Data Handling & Visualization:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Git/GitHub


## Projects Included:
Some of the key projects consolidated in this repository are:
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection** → Identifying fraudulent transactions using classification models.
- **Sentiment Analysis** → Analyzing textual reviews to classify sentiment using NLP techniques.
- **Netflix Stock Price Prediction →** Time series forecasting to predict stock movements.
(More projects added continuously...)


## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/PriyankaHichkad/Data-Science_Projects.git
3. Open the corresponding Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and run the code.
4. Refer to individual project README files (if available) for details.


## Learning Outcomes:
Through these projects, I have explored:
- Applying ML/DL algorithms to real-world problems.
- Handling imbalanced datasets and feature engineering.
- Building end-to-end ML pipelines.
- Deploying models and improving performance.
